tagline: 🧮 Fast, multilingual word counting — open-source and private
description: Tally is a free online tool to count the number of characters, words, paragraphs, and lines in your text. It can also show counts for different types of characters and runs entirely in your browser, with no accounts, ads, or privacy-invasive tracking. Unlike many tools, it supports multiple languages, computes counts in real-time, and offers a modern, themeable interface (including dark mode). Since the project is FOSS, you can easily verify its functionality or even self-host your own instance!
